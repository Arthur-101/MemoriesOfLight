## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser to view this project. No server installations are strictly required for local viewing, but a local server is recommended to avoid CORS issues with modules.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memories-of-light.git
    cd memories-of-light
    ```

2.  **Configuration**
    Ensure `firebase-config.js` is present in the root directory. If it is missing (due to `.gitignore`), create it with your project credentials:
    ```javascript
    export const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
        authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
        projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
        // ... other config values
    };
    ```

3.  **Run Locally**
    You can use a simple tool like `serve` or the VS Code "Live Server" extension.
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```
    Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
